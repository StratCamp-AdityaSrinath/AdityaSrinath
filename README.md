Step 3) With coming year we will only add new population of 4 years as rest will always be rollover population (the ones left untreated in last year)
Step 4) As we have to deduct treated patients from the population, and we do not know that how much proportion of patient is treated from the prevalent pull, we will assume that treated patients are equally contributed from patent group

Step 2) It is multiplied by the sum of specific population segment to get the prevalent cases for the base year
 Step 3) For the subsequent years, adding the incidence number to the prevalence number of the prior year and subtracting the treated patients from it, gives us the actual prevalent patient pool YoY"	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A		 166,945 	 191,699 	 216,460 	 241,246 	 265,998 	 290,729 	 315,435 	90%	Proxy: Taken diagnosis rate of Wet AMD, as Macular telangiectasia type 2 (Mac Tel 2) is an important mimics of wet AMD ( Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5602131/)	Estimated	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 150,250 	 174,898 	 199,551 	 224,229 	 248,872 	 273,493 	 298,089 	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	 16,694 	 16,801 	 16,909 	 17,017 	 17,126 	 17,236 	 17,346 	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	 42,018 	 42,285 	 42,553 	 42,823 	 43,094 	 43,368 	 43,643 	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	0.02517%	0.02506%	0.02495%	0.02486%	0.02476%	0.02465%	0.02452%	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	42%	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	 70,785 	 81,280 	 91,779 	 102,288 	 112,783 	 123,269 	 133,744 	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	 17,816 	 17,929 	 18,043 	 18,157 	 18,272 	 18,388 	 18,505 	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	0.48%	0.80%	0.89%	0.93%	1.03%	1.10%	1.16%	1.31%	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	N/A	 570 	 723 	 858 	 1,054 	 1,238 	 1,426 	 1,745 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 N/A 	 850,000 	 850,000 	 850,000 	 850,000 	 850,000 	 850,000 	 875,500 	 875,500 	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	To be updated	 Benchmark 	NT-501Telangiectasia, macular, Type 2	N/A
